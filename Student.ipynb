    "### Overview\n",
    "You've now worked with some API calls, but we have yet to see how to retrieve a more complete dataset in a programmatic manner. In this lab, you will write a query of Rick and Morty, then use *pagination* to retrieve all possible results for that query.\n",

    "#### 1. Make the Initial Request\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by filling in your API key to make the initial request to the API. Investigate the structure of the response you get back and start figuring out how you will extract the relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Add Pagination\n",
    "\n",
    "Using loops and functions, collect the maximum number of results for your query from the API."
